# Project Repository 
 
Welcome to the project repository for Team 4- the Big Bang Brokers. We are creating an intergalactic marketplace. 
This is an e-commerce experience designed for users to browse and buy planets from across the universe. 
We will be using Python, Flask, and SQLite as the foundation for our website. 
Here, we will document our presentations, artifacts, and source code for our project.
