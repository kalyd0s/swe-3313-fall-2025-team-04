# Big Bang Brokers
 
Welcome to the project repository for Team 4, the Big Bang Brokers. We are creating an intergalactic marketplace. 
This is an e-commerce experience designed for users to browse and buy planets from across the universe. 
We will be using Python, Flask, and SQLite as the foundation for our website. 
Here, we will document our presentations, artifacts, and source code for our project.

## Requirements
After working closely with our client, we identified the key requirements and functionalities neccesary for the success of our system. Our project aims to create an online marketplace where users can discover and purchase unique planets. The platform will allow users to register and log in to their accounts, browse the inventory, and complete a secure checkout process that includes payment and shipping verification. Administrative users will have additional priviledges to manage inventory, promote accounts, and oversee sales activities.  

- Our requirement document can be found here.
- Our decision table can be found here.
- Our use case diagram and description can be found here.
- Our requirements presentation video can be found here.
