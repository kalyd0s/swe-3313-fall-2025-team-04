  ## Implementation Languages
**Backend:** <br>  
  Python <br>
- Python was chosen because our team is familiar with it and it works smoothly with the Flask framework for web development.
- Python’s syntax is beginner-friendly and allows for fast development.
- Official Python documentation can be found here: [https://docs.python.org/] <br> 
**Frontend:** <br>
  HTML & CSS
- HTML and CSS will be used to build the structure and visual design of our web pages. Flask also supports HTML templates.
- Official HTML documentation: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML]
- Official CSS documentation: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS] <br>
**Data:** <br>
  SQLite <br>
- SQL will be used to create, read, update, and delete data inside our database.
- We are using SQLite because it stores everything in a single file, requires no server setup, and is simple for development.
- Official SQL documentation: [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/]
