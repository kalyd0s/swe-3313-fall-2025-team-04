# Language 

 

------

We chose Python as our primary programming language because our team has prior experience using it. Pythonâ€™s simplicity, readability, and extensive library support make it ideal for efficient problem-solving that helps rapid development.

 

## Storage 

 

We selected SQLite as our database for its lightweight design and seamless integration with Python. It allows us to store and manage data locally without requiring a complex setup or server management, making it a practical choice for our project. 

 

## Environment 

 

Our development environment includes Linux and Windows operating systems. This setup provides flexibility for team collaboration and allows for compatibility across different platforms.
